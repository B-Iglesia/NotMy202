# NotMy202
So because for some reason Cal Poly has wanted my education to fail and provide me with a very useless professor,
I will be actively taking labs from my friends in their 202 classes.
If you are one of those friends and happen to stumble upon this, let's collaborate and work on your problems
together! We both need this stuff in our careers, except you actually need it for the grade. ;)
