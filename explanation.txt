This repo is literally for labs of a class that I am ACTUALLY NOT IN. I'm not exactly gonna go into too much depth or detail when doing any of these labs. I especially won't really attempt to do TOO many test cases considering I am not doing them for a grade. Of course I will go out of my way to remember how to do test cases, but that's what local files are for :)
